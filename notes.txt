    baseFreq = 110.0 // A2
    12RootOf2 = pow(2.0, 1.0 / 12.0)

    size_t. 
    Alias of one of the fundamental unsigned integer types. 
    It is a type able to represent the size of any object in bytes: 
    size_t is the type returned by the sizeof operator and is widely used in the standard library to represent sizes and counts.

    Useful hash defines :

    #define _USE_MATH_DEFINES // For PI
    #include <math.h> // or
    #include <cmath>


| Digital wave types |
    Sine wave
        sin(Hz * Time)
    Square wave
        sin(Hz * Time) > 0.0 ? 1.0 : -1.0
    Triangle wave
        asin(sin(Hz) * Time) * 2.0 / PI

    Formula to make an interger odd:
    (2k - 1)
        From :
            2pi(2k - 1)f, where f = frequency

| Filter design |

    With FIR filters, the phase is linear but the
    latency is maximum. With IIR filtering, the phase is compromised around the
    Nyquist frequency but the latency is minimum.
