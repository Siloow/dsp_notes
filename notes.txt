| Random notes |

    baseFreq = 110.0 // A2
    12RootOf2 = pow(2.0, 1.0 / 12.0)


| Digital wave types |
    Sine wave
        sin(Hz * Time)
    Square wave
        sin(Hz * Time) > 0.0 ? 1.0 : -1.0
    Triangle wave
        asin(sin(Hz) * Time) * 2.0 / PI

| Filter design |

    With FIR filters, the phase is linear but the
    latency is maximum. With IIR filtering, the phase is compromised around the
    Nyquist frequency but the latency is minimum.
