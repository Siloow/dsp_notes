    Alias of one of the fundamental unsigned integer types. 
    It is a type able to represent the size of any object in bytes: 
    size_t is the type returned by the sizeof operator and is widely used in the standard library to represent sizes and counts.

| Filter design |

    With FIR filters, the phase is linear but the
    latency is maximum. With IIR filtering, the phase is compromised around the
    Nyquist frequency but the latency is minimum.

    In the jargon of signal processing, the input and output signals are viewed as a superposition (sum) of simpler waveforms. This is the basis of nearly all signal processing techniques.

    The general shape of low-pass and high-pass filter kernels (another name for a filter's impulse response)

    The frequency spectrum of any signal is composed of two parts, the magnitude and the phase.

    Linear systems : http://www.dspguide.com/ch5/7.htm {

        The input signal to a discrete system is usually called: x[n], and the output signal: y[n]. For continuous systems, the signals: x(t) and y(t) are used

        A system is called linear if it has two mathematical properties: homogeneity (hōma-gen-ā-ity) and additivity.
        Homogeneity means that a change in the input signal's amplitude results in a corresponding change in the output signal's amplitude. In mathematical terms, if an input signal of x[n] results in an output signal of y[n], an input of kx[n] results in an output of ky[n], for any input signal and constant, k.
        The system is said to be additive, if an input of x1[n] + x2[n] results in an output of y1[n] + y2[n], for all possible input signals. In words, signals added at the input produce signals that are added at the output.
        Shift invariance means that a shift in the input signal will result in nothing more than an identical shift in the output signal. In more formal terms, if an input signal of x[n] results in an output of y[n], an input signal of x[n + s] results in an output of y[n + s], for any input signal and any constant, s.

        Static linearity defines how a linear system reacts when the signals aren't changing, i.e., when they are DC or static.
        An important characteristic of linear systems is how they behave with sinusoids, a property we will call sinusoidal fidelity: If the input to a linear system is a sinusoidal wave, the output will also be a sinusoidal wave, and at exactly the same frequency as the input.
        
        Linearity is commutative.
        The commutative property states that the order of the systems in the cascade can be rearranged without affecting the characteristics of the overall combination.

        When we are dealing with linear systems, the only way signals can be combined is by scaling (multiplication of the signals by constants) followed by addition.
        The process of combining signals through scaling and addition is called synthesis.
        Decomposition is the inverse operation of synthesis, where a single signal is broken into two or more additive components

        In the jargon of signal processing, the input and output signals are viewed as a superposition (sum) of simpler waveforms.

    Convolution : http://www.dspguide.com/ch5/7.htm {
        Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal. It is the single most important technique in Digital Signal Processing. 
        Using the strategy of impulse decomposition, systems are described by a signal called the impulse response. 
        Convolution is important because it relates the three signals of interest: the input signal, the output signal, and the impulse response. 

        The delta function is a normalized impulse, that is, sample number zero has a value of one, while all other samples have a value of zero. For this reason, the delta function is frequently called the unit impulse.
        The impulse response is the signal that exits a system when a delta function (unit impulse) is the input.

        The impulse response goes by a different name in some applications. If the system being considered is a filter, the impulse response is called the filter kernel, the convolution kernel, or simply, the kernel.

        Convolution is a formal mathematical operation, just as multiplication, addition, and integration.  
        In linear systems, convolution is used to describe the relationship between three signals of interest: the input signal, the impulse response, and the output signal.

    Early Reflections:  the first reflections that we hear within about 100ms of hearing the direct sound of the source. 
    Late Reverberation: the reverberant sound field after about 100ms, until it fully decays.
        Late reverb is characterized by a dense texture of diffused reflections that reach our ears from
        many different paths. These diffused reflections are out of phase with one another, causing us
        to hear the comb filtering effect. We perceive this as ambience.
    
    RT60 - the reverberation time, RT60, is the time it takes for the acoustic signal to decay by
        60dB. The reverb time varies throughout the spectrum, and can be measured at discrete
        frequency values. For practical applications, averaging schemes are used to define the reverb
        time in the portion of the spectrum where human hearing is most sensitive (between about
        125 Hz and 4000 Hz is where we perceive the most significant sound colouration by reverb).
        RT60 is defined according to the Sabine and Eyring equations [1] as a function the volume of
        a room and the absorption of sound energy inside that room.
